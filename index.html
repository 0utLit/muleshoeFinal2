              <h2>Welcome!</h2>
              <p>
                Muleshoe Antiques is a locally owned shop operating in downtown
                Victor, Colorado and we have been in business for 10 years now.
                We supply an assortment of unique vintage treasures from across
                the state. Our antiques come from a wide variety of sources. A
                large portion comes from Colorado estate sales, yard sales,
                eBay, and thrift stores. Some antiques are passed down from
                family and friends. We also feature items from right here in the
                Cripple Creek District, including a prominent bottle collection,
                with most pieces personally discovered by the store owner.

              <h3>The City of Gold Mines</h3>
              <p>
                Victor was established in the late 1800s as a small town
                catering to ranchers and early settlers. Around 1891, large gold
                deposits were discovered in the nearby town of Cripple Creek,
                and the gold rush began. Thousands of fortune seekers were drawn
                in when word spread that gold had been discovered. In the
                following years, the population exploded, and the Cripple
                Creek-Victor area became one of the richest gold mining
                districts in North America. Today, Victor has a humble
                population of around 350 people, with much of its historic
                infrastructure still intact. It is now a quiet town with a few
                small businesses, such as The Claim Jumper general store, The
                Gold Camp Bakery, Muleshoe Antiques, The Black Monarch Hotel,
                and a few others.
